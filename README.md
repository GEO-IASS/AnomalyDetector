AnomalyDetector
===============

Matlab code for spatiotemporal anomaly detection



Intro 
-----------------------------

The source code is tested with Matlab R2009b on a Linux system.

No non-standard libraries are used except tight_subplot.m 
for visualization purposes. This file is included in the working directory.

Cleaned and aligned sensor data is also provided in the "data" folder.  


Testing
-------

The non-parametric approach can be tested by typing 
"nonparametric_approach" in the working directory.

The probabilistic approach can be tested by typing 
"probabilistic_approach" in the working directory.

Both methods produce the test results in a few seconds.
